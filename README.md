# Audio-Visualizer

### Application that allows users to select a song or upload their own and see a visualization of the frequency on screen.

Utilizing the Web Audio API, this project was developed by parsing audio frequency and waveform data into usable JavaScript arrays and then drawing canvas visuals according to array values. This project thus involved a deep understanding of the Web Audio API's audio graph and the ability to construct various nodes for manipulation of frequencies and analysis. Event handlers are used to allow for real-time user manipulation of the audio playback and visual artwork. I also ensured a pleasing user experience by designing a simple and minimalist UI that allows for user control and understanding of the software while still maintaining a clear emphasis on the visual components.
